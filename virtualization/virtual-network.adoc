== Setting Up a Virtual Network in virt-manager

To set up a new virtual network in virt-manager, follow these steps:

. Open virt-manager and right-click the name of the connection for which you want to set up
the virtual network, and select Details.
. Click the Virtual Networks tab, then click the plus '+' button in the lower part
to add a new virtual network
. Fill the name of the new virtual network and confirm with Forward.
. Specify network address space, and DHCP settings for both IPv4 and IPv6 as required.
. Specify whether you want an isolated network, or network forwarded to a physical existing network.
An isolated network hosts cannot access are not accessible form the external network, 
while hosts belonging to a forwarded network can make use of the VM host's physical network interface
  to access the external network.
. Specify the DNS domain name, usually same as the VM host's domain name. Run `dnsdomainname` to find it.
